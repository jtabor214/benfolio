        <p>I got my start in media at fifteen years old when I was presented with the incredible opportunity to produce The Create Unknown podcast. Hosted by Kevin Lieber and Matthew Tabor of the highly successful science education YouTube channel Vsauce2, the show is dedicated to interviewing the industry’s most innovative creators in both traditional and online media spaces to explore creative process. Over the six-years and nearly 250 episodes I have had the invaluable experience of learning what it means to produce a show, and have been fantastically fortunate to absorb wisdom from so many talented creators. From the hilarity of showrunners Zach Hadel and Michael Cusack to the sage wisdom of comedy writing veteran Jose Arroyo, I’ve had access to a wealth of creative knowledge akin to the Library of Alexandria itself. My time as Executive Producer for The Create Unknown
          has truly defined the way I think about creating, and has been instrumental in my media journey.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I continued that journey through my studies at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University where I pursued a degree in Television, Radio, and Film. There, I was able to combine my background in the online space with a more traditional, yet still innovative, media education. Not only was I able to learn from a number of seasoned industry professionals, but I was also able to pursue a wealth of extra curricular opportunities to further develop my own skills. The most formative project I took part in was Live From Studio B, a student-run bi-weekly live sketch comedy show in the style of Saturday Night Live. I began my time there as a writer, which is where I discovered my true passion for screenwriting. In my final year, I moved to the role of Executive Producer, which allowed me to build upon the skills I began developing with The Create Unknown.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I was also fortunate enough to finish my degree at SU within three years, and had the fantastic opportunity of spending my final semester at the Newhouse Los Angeles campus for the Summer 2024 semester. There, I was able to learn the ropes of Hollywood from actively working professionals, and got some hands-on experience of my own through my internship at Voltage Pictures.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Since finishing my degree at Syracuse, I’ve moved to LA permanently and couldn’t be happier. I’ve also started working as a writer for Popular Science, where I specialize in writing long-form content for their YouTube channel, and have been able to travel the world to develop a host of exciting projects. Working for such an iconic and long-standing institution has been a massive honor, and I’m looking forward to all of the excellent content coming soon.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My media career so far has been surprisingly eventful, but undoubtedly exciting. I’m truly grateful for the opportunities I’ve been presented thus far, and incredibly eager for whatever comes next.</p>
